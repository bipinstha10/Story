Here, the file called 'chapter1.txt' is inside Story folder and the Story is the working directory. Working directory is the directory where we initialize the git repository using the command "git init". Once we initialize the git repository, the git try and track the changes that it sees between the working directory and local repository. To track the changes made in the file chapter1.txt we need to add the file to the "Staging Area". We use the command "git status" to see what are inside the staging area. Now to add the file chapter1.txt to the staging area means to track the changes on the file we use the command "git add chapter1.txt"
There is a staging area in between working directory and git repository. It is the intermediate stage and the reason to have this stage is that some times we don't want all the files to be tracked and we may not want to commit the all changes, so it is better to have stage like this to make a decision.
